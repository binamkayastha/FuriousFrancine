# Furious Francine [Abandoned]

A project done at a GameJam, which was incomplete largely due to the fact that it was during finals week, and lost interested thereafter. May potentially come back to this in the future, if I ever feel the compulsion of wanting to ride a segway as a grandma.

Furious Francine has been put down due to ugliness and lack of motivation.
